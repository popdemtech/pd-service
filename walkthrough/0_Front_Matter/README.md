# Build a `smartsite` by Popular Demand

*Web Application Fundamentals Made Simple*

This is a guide to Web Development.

The purpose of Build a SmartSite is to provide interested individuals with
a blueprint for building a personal web application.

### Prerequisites

Before beginning, the individual must be able to:
<ol type="a">
  <li>Download and install programs</li>
  <li>Browse the internet</li>
  <li>Use the command-line interface</li>
</ol>

Using the command-line interface is likely the least familiar of the skills.
Commands that are **necessary** for building the application
will be given by the walkthrough. Still, because the command-line will be one of the primary development tools, beginner level proficiency is recommended.

The guides will present a path of Node.js web development that it known to work.
Differences in operating system and setup may require modifications to the instructions.

### Content Layout

The building process is presented in three parts:
1. Setup
2. Basics
3. Features

Each part contains the theory behind the components to be added
to the `smartsite`. Implementation details are given as step-by-step walkthroughs.

### Setup
The Setup section ensures the developer has the required libraries
and programs installed. Anyone who has been developing web applications
for any amount of time may already have libraries like Node.js and PostgreSQL installed.
Regardless, go through the setup steps to ensure parity with the example application.

### Basics
The Basics covers the key building blocks for creating a web application.
* Deliver static HTML pages
* Deliver dynamically rendered content
* Provide interactive front-end content
* Connect to a database
* Save user information in the database

After completing the Basics, the developer will have completed building a
full-fledged Web 2.0 application. With curiosity and initiative, any type of web
application can be built from the skills and tools outlined in the Basics.

### Features
The third section, Features, is an exploration of the range of applications
can be built from the tooling of the Basics. Features contains walkthroughs
for extending the functionality of smartsite.

The Features are standalone front-end or full-stack modules that can be completed in any order.

### How to Begin
Begin with the **Setup** instructions which include installing core libraries and running the Node installation commands.

As you continue through the tutorial, what began as a directory with not much more than a walkthrough blossoms into a featured and interactive web application. This application can serve as your personal site, small-business database system, or become a product prototype.

### What Next
After you've comepleted building out `smartsite`, you will have the tools of web development in hand. With the skills, you can:

* Provide value on the internet with your app ideas
* Continue learning web development in pursuit of a career in software
* Prototype the next Big Idea (you'll know as much as Zuckerberg)

If you find yourself building out cool new features in your `smartsite`, aid future learners by contributing a walkthrough to the `smartsite` parent repository. It will be added to the **Features** section as an optional `smartsite` add-on. Thanks in advance!

Happy Building.
